This is my attempt to meet the design criteria so far.
I did not do a lot of restructuring in HTML, did more changes and adjustments in CSS.  I have so far made the page responsive and adjusted the colored bars, text appearance, and spacing.  As of 1/6/2021, I still need to fix the text as it is not EXACTLY like the design specs.  I hope to receive constructive criticism to see what I could have done differently.  For example, I did not redo the CSS to use the H3 but used what was already there to make the changes, should I have just changed to H3 to use in CSS? Thanks in advance for any advice!
