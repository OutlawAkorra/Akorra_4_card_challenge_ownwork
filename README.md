# Akorra_4_card_challenge_ownwork
Hello!  I used the existing code to achieve the desired results.  I used HTML/CSS to accomplish this though it was more CSS.  As this is my first project/challenge, I wasn't quite sure how to go about it.  As a result, some of the code is messy and uneccessary.  An example was should I have just used h3 instead of the provided class for css purposes? I welcome any feedback so I can improve.
